# Workout Generator App
## Description
This app allows a user to generate a random workout taking into account how many days they want to workout that week, and how hard they would like to train.

## Feature 1: Workout Generator
This feature generates a randomised workout for the user after asking the user how many days they would like to train, and how hard they would like to train. The training difficulty setting will change the number of sets the user must complete.

## Feature 2: One-Rep Max Logger
This feature allows the user to enter their current one-rep maxes for squat, bench, and deadlift. These maxes along with the date are stored in an external csv file so as to be retrieved after quitting the app and using it again later.

Another use of this feature is to view some of the recently entered one-rep maxes, along with the dates they were entered.

A third use of this feature is to tell the user their IPF score (a common powerlifting benchmark), using the IPF score formula, their latest total one-rep max, their bodyweight, and gender.

## Feature 3: Exercise Manager
This feature allows the user to view the exercises that are used to randomly generate workouts in the app.

Another use of this feature is to remove exercises that the user does not want to be suggested.

The user may also reset this list back to its original state if they want removed exercises to be added again.

## Coding Style Guide
The app code follows the PEP 8 coding standards available at [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/).
